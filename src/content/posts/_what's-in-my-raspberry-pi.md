title: Whatâ€™s in my Raspberry Pi?
description: A couple of years ago I bought myself a Raspberry Pi, a small, energy-efficient, fully-functional computer that is often used for studying or hobbies. I am using it as a home server self-hosting some websites locally to have more control and flexibility over data and functionality of them. My Pi setup went through several iterations and is still evolving. I'd like to share with you the current state of it and future plans that I'm having. I think it really interesting in modern Everything-as-a-Service world to realize how many things we can still do by ourselves.

### Pi-hole

If you have ever searched anything on the Internet, you should be pissed of by the amount of ads modern websites have. It can literally be just a simple cooking recipe page, where after each step there is reserved space for a targeting ad

> step 1: cut the onion into small rings...
> do you want to grow back lost hair and have a new side-chick every week-end?!...
> step 2: grate carrots on a fine grater...
> 5 steps to become insanely rich today, Bill Gates didn't want you to know it!!...

Free mobile apps and games also have this decease, after all they have to somehow monetize themselves. If you get some service but do not pay with money, you most likely pay with your time or also with money but a little bit later. Marketing people do know their stuff well, so those ads are in motion and blinking all the time to attract your attention at any cost.

But for every action there is a reaction, so a long time ago ad-blocking software emerged. It cannot block internal website adds like pre-rolls of YouTube, or ad posts of Facebook, but it can block external ads like the examples from above. The way this software works is that it intercepts all of device outgoing internet traffic, goes over it with a huge block-list of known ad platforms and blocks every request if it happens to be directed to one of block-listed addresses. So usual request for example to get recipe steps passes, but the request to retrieve the ad info to show fails hence it is not shown.

One problem with those programs is that they should be running in the background all the time. And while on PC it is probably ok, but on laptops and phones we have batteries, that are drained more and more with each background process. Then you have install it on each and every of your devices that you'd like to avoid ads. Separate app for laptop, separate app for phone. Most likely those apps are written by different developers, so the quality of the software probably varies. And I'm not even mention that stores like Google Play or App Store really don't like those kinda apps, since they decrease their ad income.

So one of the most popular apps that is meant to be used with Raspberry Pi is a [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/), network-wide ad blocker. After you configure it (which is not so trivial unfortunately), it still runs all the time, but it runs on energy-efficient computer, and it can intercept all the traffic your whole Wi-Fi network, so you don't have to do anything with other devices. But obviously the moment you go outside your home, Wi-Fi is lost and ads are back, so each solution has its own trade-offs.

### FreshRSS + RSSHub

![FreshRSS Logo](../attachments/what's-in-my-raspberry-pi/freshrss-logo.svg)

Back in the old days when there were no social networks if you wanted to have blog, you had to have one, not just to create a profile in some platform, but to maintain a fully-featured website (like the one you are reading right now). From the author perspective entry level for blogging in such environment was a much higher than what we have right now, but he/she had total freedom and ownership of his/her content. From the reader perspective entry point also was a little bit tricky: in order to build nice and convenient post feed with updates from all of your subscriptions you had to come up with something, nobody wanted manually go over a list of sites on a regular basis. So people invented RSS protocol.

RSS protocol is sort of standard contract between tools that blog authors use to build their blog and apps that readers can use to consume content. For example my blog also has RSS feed: you can navigate to [https://vorant94.io/](https://vorant94.io) and see human-friendly list of recent posts, but you also can navigate to [https://vorant94.io/rss.xml](https://vorant94.io/rss.xml) to get the same list of posts that can be easily passed to one of many RSS aggregators. Combine and render together dozens of such robot-friendly blogs in a timeline manner and you'll get RSS feed. App that you would use to read such a feed is a RSS reader. FreshRSS is exactly all of the above, it is RSS aggregator, reader and feed combined in one

### Tech setup

I have a [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) with 8 Gb of RAM. It is wired connected to [Asus RT-AX55](https://www.asus.com/networking-iot-servers/wifi-routers/all-series/rt-ax55/) Wi-Fi router, which among other things allows to configure your own custom DNS-server

> Domain Name System (DNS) in short words is service that provides configuration between computer real physical addresses in the network (like 8.8.8.8) and human-readable names that we all using (like google.com)

As of now I have there [Manjaro Linux OS](https://manjaro.org/)

docker compose with nginx reverse proxy
