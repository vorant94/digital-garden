title: Whatâ€™s in my Raspberry Pi?
description: A couple of years ago I bought myself a Raspberry Pi, a small, energy-efficient, fully-functional computer that is often used for studying or hobbies. I am using it as a home server self-hosting some websites locally to have more control and flexibility over data and functionality of them. My Pi setup went through several iterations and is still evolving. I'd like to share with you the current state of it and future plans that I'm having. I think it really interesting in modern Everything-as-a-Service world to realize how many things we can still do by ourselves.

## Tech setup

I have a [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) with 8 Gb of RAM. It is wired connected to [Asus RT-AX55](https://www.asus.com/networking-iot-servers/wifi-routers/all-series/rt-ax55/) Wi-Fi router, which among other things allows to configure your own custom DNS-server

> Domain Name System (DNS) in short words is service that provides configuration between computer real physical addresses in the network (like 8.8.8.8) and human-readable names that we all using (like google.com)

As of now I have there [Manjaro Linux OS](https://manjaro.org/)

docker compose with nginx reverse proxy
